### Overview

This repo contains client prototypes for the Tin Can API.

* GolfExample\_TCAPI: a converted SCORM course, it can be packaged and launched from an LMS supporting Tin Can API, it generates statements and uses the State API for "bookmarking"
* JsTetris\_TCAPI: Tetris game generating statements and using the Activity Profile API
* Locator\_TCAPI: a location based activity, it generates statements
* ReportSample: basic and activity-specific reporting on the statements generated by the above samples
* StatementViewer: statement stream viewer with rudimentary query ability
* OAuthSample: simple page for testing the OAuth compatibility of a Tin Can endpoint

### Installation

Make sure to fetch all the code dependencies by running ```git submodule update --init --recursive```

* Place the prototypes folder on a web server, and note the URL to index.html. This is the url you will launch in your browser to run the client prototypes. If you do not have a webserver available you should be able to run the prototypes from your desktop, but you will have to use a modern browser that supports CORS (Cross Origin Requests) such as Chrome, Safari, Firefox or IE8+.
* Copy the file `config.js.template` to `config.js` and set `Config.endpoint` to the LRS endpoint, including a trailing slash (ex: https://cloud.scorm.com/tc/public/)
* Verify the LRS endpoint in your browser by navigating to the URL: &lt;endpoint&gt;/statements?limit=1
	* You should be prompted to log in, use the credentials provided by the LRS
	* You should then see: [], or JSON of a statement if statements have already been stored for this LRS.
* Load `index.html` in a browser
